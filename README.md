# Fantom DeFi Smart Contracts
The repository implements Fantom DeFi smart contracts in Solidity based 
on [Andre Cronje's  flend](https://github.com/andrecronje/flend) implementation.

Please note we use [OpenZeppelin](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts) 
library version 2.5 along with the Solidity 0.5 to conform with the EVM implemented 
in the Opera block chain.

# How to use
The repository uses [Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/) to handle deployment 
of the contracts. Please refere to Truffle manual to handle the contract 
testing and deployment.
